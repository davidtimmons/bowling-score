_Bowling Score_ is a Python service that manages a bowling game for multiple players.

The service takes in pins knocked down, tracks frame scores, and calculates a running total
for each player. Scoring is based on the tutorial found at the _ThoughtCo. ["Bowling Scoring"](http://bowling.about.com/od/rulesofthegame/a/bowlingscoring.htm)_ article.

Tested with Python 3.6.1.

## Features:

+ Configure the number of players in the game.
+ Configure the number of pins in the game.
+ Configure the number of frames in the game.

## Usage:

+ Instantiate the `BowlingController` class to start a new game.
+ Unit and integration tests can be found in the `tests` directory.
